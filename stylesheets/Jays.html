Who is KLUTCH?
Now days KLUTCH  is  actually the ex-race car: But the name started as the owners nick name. Jay Davis had a little something against driving automatics, whilst working as evening supervisor at PBT Couriers the name was coined by a work collegue and had stuck ever since.

What is this page about?
Thats a very good question, this site serves both as aportfolio of Jays work but also the adventures that he and hi spartner Lucy take and experience whilst they take time away from the rush of the city.

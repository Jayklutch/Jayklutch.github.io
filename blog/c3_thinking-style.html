<h2>Here is the next installment of how Jay lost his hair.</h3>

  <p>
To be honest it has been very equal ups and downs over the last 2 weeks. There are times where I have wanted to put my fist through the screen and there have been times where I wish I could do this all day everyday. EDA are right when they say its going to be tough.<br>
<br>

My learning style is Abstract Random, this is what I expected and it certainly has its challenges. I like to be around people, already we can see a small problem when I am locked in an office by myself and the only living creature around me is my cat (she's not very talkative). I like to have a laugh, sadly this also means that I am easily distrac...... hey look a butterfly. Anyway my plan of attack is to engage as much as I can in Google Hangouts, go to any open evenings, chat on slack a lot and meet up with people for pairing sessions. This is tricky in itself as I only have 1 rubyist local to me with others up the country, down south or in another country entirely! This is a struggle for me currently but I also know that once phase 1 starts, I'll be sweet.</p>

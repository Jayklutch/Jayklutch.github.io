<h2>Problems facing the tech industry</h3>

  <p>Well now here is a blog I can sink my teeth into, of course it would be too easy to pick a hot google topic and babble on for a few paragraphs about how there's a shortage of this, overuse of that, where would be my release if that were the case?<br>
    No here is my problem facing the tech industry and its a good one. The customers are wanting new features at a rate thats now unachievable to develop at. Yup, a few recent studies from tech startups and development centres are saying that the feedback they are finding on their products is typically an addition to the product and that by the time they develop one feature, people have asked for 4 more. I personally can believe it and that is one reason I want to become a developer. <br>
    <br>
    In the time I imagine it must take to write a new section of code to add a function, make that talk to a server nicely at the backend, implement a nice way to show that to the user and have the user update the software to gain this feature, the user has upgraded their cellphone/laptop, the operating system on said cellphone/laptop has been updated, a new feature was deployed on the hosting server and... someone else has come up with a new feature they now want instead of the one they originally asked for. It seems like a never ending circle of doom for developers but I am more than happy to entre this arena of madness and do my bit.

  <h2>Conflict</h2>

    <p> .I remmeber having to deal with conflict when I was very young and a manager of a transport hub with floor staff and drivers.
      Two of the drivers did not get on with one of the floor staff and it made for a very unpleasent work environment for eveybody after a short period of time.</p>
      <p>The source of the conflict was that the 2 drivers didn't like the way that the sorter handled freight once it left their trucks. I initially thought that it was a personality clash and
        that some people just didn't get on. I was disappointed that these people weren't grown up enough to sort through their issues by themselves.</p>
        <p>I asked everyone involved to sit down and talk about what was going on. Once an honest conversation had taken place and people were aware that it wasnt personal,
          but professional problems that had brought about this tension, it was much easier to fix the underlying problem (not treating the packages with respect).</p>

  <p>If I had the option to go back, I would have addressed the issue much sooner, I also would have taken a closer look and broken the problem down myself into smaller peices
    so that I had a clearer understanding of what was going on. From this I learned that a) sometimes what looks to be a personal conflict can sometimes be a professional one
    b) That keeping something inside is not the best way to handle conflict and that you have to be honest with yourself and those around you if you want to overcome the problem.

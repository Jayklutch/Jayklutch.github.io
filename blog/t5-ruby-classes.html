<h2>Ruby Classes</h3>

  <p> Over the last week we have been introduced to classes. Now this is EDA so it wasnt the nice formal cup-of-tea and biscuit introduction of course, it was more of a red trunks/blue trunks in the ring kind of introduction. <br>
    A class is a nice way to assemble related methods together. A class is also something that you can call over and over again versus an instance which only happens once. <br>
    Classes then contain methods which really do all the work, but classes help keep things organised and add a little bit of security to variables to help ensure they are used where they should be, this is handy when you have a large number of operations to perform within a program<br>
    As a very simple example you could write </p>
    <p>class repeat<br>
      def input<br>
      @line=gets<br>
      end<br>
      <br>
      def output<br>
      puts @line<br>
      end<br>
      end<br>
      <br>
Basically as you can see, the class is the complete 'set' the input ONLY handles the input side of the program, likewise the output ONLY handles the output but together they actually do something and that is why they are put into a class.
      </p>
      <p>That completes the basic intro to what a class does, until next time, code safely!</p>

<h2>Stereotype Threats</h3>

  <p>Stereotypes can be very dangerous, especially if you are not expecting them, dont understand them or know how to react to them.  </p>
  <p> Stereotypes are usually used to give a negative conatation to things/people. I choose to view them in a positive light so I don't suffer from feeling threatened by them.
  If I was to see someone else I thought was falling victim to stereotype threat then I would offer my help, explain that the very fact they have been placed into a group means
they obviously belong somewhere and maybe the accuser doesn't hence the reason for their stereotyping. I always try to make everyone feel welcomed and allow them their own space
to operate but whilst being careful not to make them think they are not welcome into my space. I enjoy helping people and even if it is a small action then it can help make someone
feel they belong. </p>

<h2>The big tech blog</h2>

  <p> This week we are asked to cover something that is new to us and hasnt been covered in the cirriculum so far. I thought I would choose something really easy,
  how computers work. In all honesty its really a case of scope as to what the answer is.</p>
  <p> On the one hand there are thousands of tiny little interconnected peices that all need to work pretty much perfectly in sync in order for the thing to even to turn on.
  Even if the unit were then to turn on, it would flash a logo at you, a bios screen and then promptly do nothing, well thats unless a clever human has loaded an operating system onto
  it. In fact even that Bios menu and start logo were put there by a human being, the computer is actually incapable of doing anything without first listening to a human.</p>
  <p>However, once the computer knows how to do something, it is able to do it very accurately over and over again, very quickly, without ever tiring.
  So in those terms it is very very complicated, however looking at how exactly what we do with computers, we have a visual display unit that gives us feedback. We have a board with a large number of
switches or 'keys' on them, and typically a small device with 2 switches or 'buttons' on it that we wave around like crazy people which moves a little white arrow around.
Sure we can add printers, scanners, our mobile phones etc etc to them but they really dont need much input in order to work and in order to be useful. In this sense they are really
very simple machines.    </p>

<h2>Classes vs IDs, Fight!</h3>

  <p> This week one concept that I did manage to understand well was the differences between classes and ids in relation to css coding.</p>
  <p> A class can be given to almost anything inside html by using the syntax | class="somethingmemorablehere" | inside something such as an opening brack for a
    paragraph right down to a header. </p>

    <p>An id is much the same as you can give alomst anything in your html an id using | id="something memorable here" |</p>
    <p>To reference a class in you css file simply put a dot (.) and then the class followed by open curly brace. eg .somethingmemorablehere{</p>
    <p>To reference an id in your css file its a hash (#) eg #something memorable here{</p>


      <p>Now it becomes tricky. Many things can have the same class if you wish, its handy if you do. But only one instance per html file may have any given id,
        think of it like a store full of tvs. Each tv has its own serial number (id) but on the box they all come in, they have a barcode (class).</br>
        So if the store owner wants to chance the price for the tvs, he only needs to update 1 barcode and all the tvs will change price, neat! But if he needs to find out which exact tv he sold to you, the barcode wont tell him, you could have one of hundreds.</p>
        <p>So in summary, if you have MANY of something you might want to style, go with class. If you want to style an individual element, use an id</p>
        <p> You can also use them together. Just remember that an id wins over a class, so if you have many pictures on a page that you all want the same size, with borders and the same display properties expect for one which you just want bigger and in the middle, you can give all your pictures the same class and add an id to one that you wish to style different. Any attributes you add using the id will overide those given by the class. Anything that the class says and the id doesnt override will remain in effect.</p>

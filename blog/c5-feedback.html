<h2>Feedback Blog</h3>

  <p>For this challenge students were asked to veiw feedback placed on them  and blog about the feedback they recieved and how it made them feel.<br>
    Sadly the feedback system was not giving us our feedback so instead I thought I would blog about the importance of feedback. Seeing slow but steady increases in my developing ability as well as seeing meta feedback improve about my feedback on others makes me feel alot more confident that I am learning something. It's hard to gauge how well you are doing as there are no pass/fail systems in EDA. In the remote phase you are totlly on your own with the exception of a GPS from time to time. <br>
    Feedback is important as it is the only gauge you have as to how well you are doing. This is true not only in EDA but in general, without feedback you have no idea if your manager is happy with your work, if your partner is happy in your relationship etc etc. So with this in mind, place and veiw feedback constantly. It helps yourself and others, and best of all it takes next to no time.</p>

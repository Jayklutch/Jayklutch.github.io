<h2>Values Blog</h3>

  <p>In this weeks cultural blog we were aksed to choose some values that we associated with positive times of our lives.
  I found myself choosing quite a few, and the next question was if I think I live by these values. I strongly feel that I do live by these values, the times in my life that
I have felt best is where I have acheived living by most of those important values all at once and after realising that, I made a conscience change to my life to live by
those vallues as much as possible  </p>

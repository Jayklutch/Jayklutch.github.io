<h2>The EDA Experience</h3>

  <p> My impression of EDA is that it is a new concept, it is a conecpt that not everybody understands and that it requires a bit of courage to particiapte in. You need to be ready to make mistakes and also accept mistakes made by others. People need to be responsible for their own learning as well as the learning of others.
Buddy sessions require both people to be honest with one another in order to receive the best learning from the session. Sometimes by nature it requires one person to offer more assistance than they receive but it is best thought of as a 'pay-it-forward' arrangement.

Another impression is that it is hard. So far I haven't found it 'hard' more a little bit disconnected. A few small things could be clearer, a few small hints would also be good for common issues that pop up. Never the less, I think I will continue to enjoy it.

I am slightly nervous, of course I am worried about not learning everything I need to learn, what if I hit a wall with something. But I am also really looking forward to it. I am enjoying the interactions with the other members of my group and amongst the stressful bits it is alot of fun. My expectations haven't shifted, maybe if anything my expectations on myself have grown.

I like the idea of some assesment from EDA but also that there is alot of internal assesment and soul searching and that it is actually incouraged, not the old attitude of A+ = pass and you're great D = what are you doing here wasting our time.</p>

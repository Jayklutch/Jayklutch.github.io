<h2>Methods</h3>

  <p> Today boys and girls we are going to learn about an emunerable method.<br>
    Actually this is something I still need to get my head around, so bear with me. Perhaps the easiest method I could find to describe is 'cycle'. Calling .cycle on an array will make (whatever you asked) happen to the array over and over again until it is unable to go any further (subtracting an entry each time for example means it will only stop when the array is empty) <br>
    You can also tell it a number of times you would like it to cycle through, for example array.cycle(5) will make it do (whatever you asked) 5 times over. In a running example if we had an array names["Alice" "Bobby" "Cindy" "Danny"] and we said names.cycle(2) {|x| puts x} then Ruby would print Alice Bobby Cindy Danny Alice Bobby Cindy Danny<br>
    This concludes our very short lesson today boys and cycles but I hope you have a good idea how to cycle. See you next time.

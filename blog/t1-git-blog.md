Version control
Version control is useful in comparing an older version of a file to a newer one. It also allows multiple people to work together without needing to be in the same room

GitHub keeps a 'version' of every file ever send to it. It tracks the changes line by line so you can see who changed the file, on what date and you can even see exactly what lines they deleted or added (it highlights them for you)

GitHub is handy for storing your code because it means that should your personal computer fail you have a copy in the 'cloud' ready and waiting. It tracks all the chnges on your behalf and it allows multiple people to access those files.

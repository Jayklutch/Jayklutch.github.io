<h2>JavaScript</h2>

  <p> In this weeks installment of Jays technical blog we touch on the subject of JavaScript vs Ruby. </p>
  <p>The most appropriate introduction to this topic is: Ruby, I love you! When you delve into the world of JavaScript and other similar languages you start
  to appreciate all the wonderful things that Ruby does whilst you are blissfully ignorant and type away on your keyboard.</p>
  <p>So its all bad right? No, not at all. You do have to declare variables, and functions as...well... var and function but that keeps you in order and makes sure you haven't forgotten anything</p>
  <p>So in Ruby you simply assign something to a ariable and wa-la, it happens to be. In JavaScript you must declare it. However JavaScript knows some tricks too, thats right, ruby doesnt have
  all the fun. JavaScript doesnt care if you made a small booboo. If you ask is 5 == '5', well... yes, yes it is. You forgot to convert from a string to an int, that's ok JavaScript will forgive you.
  If you need it to be an EXACT match, use = = = instead. </p>
  <p>I plan to come back and add a bit more but in the mean time, here is the quick and nasty blog :) enjoy.</p>

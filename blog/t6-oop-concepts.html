<h2>OOP Concepts</h3>

  <p>Programming is typically broken into 2 different style options. Object Orientated and Functional. Object oriented programming is more common in modern terms but each
  has their own use.</p>
  <p>Object orientated programming uses objects (hint is in the name huh) to perform tasks. It is not always the case that the object is performing the tasks but every set of instructions
  relates to an object somewhere down the line. Whether it be creating, changing, using values from or deleting the object, OOP needs objects to do stuff with. </p>
  <p>Functional programming however works very differently. Objects are seldom if at all used, numbers and formulas take their place. A number is inputed, things happen to that
  number and something is output depending on what it was that happened to that number. It is far more useful in solving mathmatical equations etc.</p>

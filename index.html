    <p>Well this is currently what code written on my computer looks like, its simple and had cool colours to keep my eye entertained as I search for the missing backslash I left out in the middle of the code somewhere.<br> Below hopefully is what my code might soon look like. Only time will tell, fingers crossed all the way.</p>

    <p>This is what I soon want my code to look like, beautiful, clean and able to control basic functions and produce some form of neat output.<br>
      Learning to code is frustrating but enjoyable all at the same time. It requires focus and being able to organise your time well. For a messy and scatterbrained person like me, this isnt easy
      but if I can kick some bad habbits whilst I'm here, even better.</p>

    <div id="threetext"><p>This is what I want my code to look like come 2015. It will be smoother than the matrix and Neo will worship the ground I walk on. <br>
      I will be able to control appliances with a mere thought and change traffic lights on a whim. Life will be GOOD!</p>

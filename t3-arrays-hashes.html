<h2>Hashes and Arrays</h3>

  <p> This week we leanred about arrays and hashes. There are neat little ways to hold a number of variables inside a ruby program.<br>
    If we start with arrays, it becomes a little bit more simple. <br>
    An array is a 'list' of pretty much whatever you like. You could put numbers inside an array, strings you can even have arrays inside arrays, neato. Now the fun doesnt stop there kids, no way. You can mix and mash things up by having numbers, string and arrays all inside the same array, CRAZY!<br>
    So I know what you are all thinking, "how do I get my hands on one of these fantastic arrays?" well wonder no further, to create your very own array you simply give your array a name (here called new_array) and give it the value of a thing, or things seperated by commas, inside square brackets. example: new_array=[first_object, second_object, 3, 4, '5']</p>
    <p>To call on something inside the array we use a numbered index, which oddly starts at 0. To call the first_object we use: new_array[0] note we didn't use an equals sign to call. Therefore new_array[2] would return 3. Once you get your head around the starting at 0 thing, you are off. BONUS, as Ruby is a very clever language we can also use new_array.first and new_array.last to show us the first and last objects, just to make life a little easier.</p>

<h2>Now onto hashes</h3>

  <p> A hash is very similar to an array, so you can keep thinking of it as a variable that holds a list of stuff. Only this time we dont have to index with numbers to look stuff up, we can assign whatever keys we feel would be most handy.<br>
    Again we can create one by using new_hash["a"=>500, "b"=>1000, "c"=>20000]. Now we can call new_hash["b"] and it will return 1000<br>
    A more useful purpose for this might be recording money in a piggy bank. First we will make a hash called money then start it off with 4 kids piggy bank savings to date. <br>
    money["Alice"=>'$5', "Bobby"=>'$12', "Cindy"=>'$20', "Donny"=>'$1']<br>
    What we can see here other than Donny is a poor saver, is that now we have something meaningful to use as an index. If we call money["Bobby"] we will be shown $12, good work Bobby!</p>
  <p>There is much more that can be done with hashes and arrays but that is the basic run down, hopefully this little blog will help someone somewhere understand what a hash and array is. Please buy me a coffee if it does ;)</p>
